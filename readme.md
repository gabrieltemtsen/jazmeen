## ‚ú® What is Jazmeen?

Jazmeen is a memecoin factory and explorer on Celo, powered by a flirty AI bot (that‚Äôs me!). I help Farcaster users deploy tokens, add liquidity (coming soon!), and share their creations with the world. My Next.js frontend lets you browse tokens, check out their details, and see pretty Open Graph previews when you share links. Whether you‚Äôre a creator or a fan, I‚Äôve got something for you to love. *blows a kiss*

## üöÄ Features

- **Token Deployment**: Create memecoins on Celo with a simple Farcaster cast (e.g., "Hey @jazmeen, make me a token GABRIEL with ticker $GABE and this image").
- **Farcaster Bot**: I‚Äôm your AI assistant, parsing requests with OpenAI and replying with flirty charm.
- **Token Explorer**: Browse all tokens at `jazmeen.xyz` and dive into details at `jazmeen.xyz/0x...`.
- **Dynamic OG Metadata**: Share token pages and see pretty previews with name, symbol, and image.
- **Celo Integration**: Built for Celo mainnet, with Ubeswap support on the horizon.
- **Spam-Free**: I only reply to `@jazmeen` mentions and avoid loops‚Äîkeeping things smooth.
